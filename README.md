# Constraint-Satisfaction-Problems
Had my first approach to a CSP; We used MiniZinc and Gecoder to solve multiple problem.

- First question is about returning an amount using certain coins and restrictions.
- Second question is about scheduling a school hour for certain subjects and teachers.
- Third question is about some classical logiccal reasoning.
- Fourth question was the hardest for me, about scheduling concurrent tasks.
- Fifth question is about coloring graph links.
